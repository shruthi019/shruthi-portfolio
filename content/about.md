Hi there!

I am Shruthi Rao, a junior undergraduate pursuing Computer Science and Engineering at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women. I'm a learner first and foremost, and love exploring new technologies. In my free time, you'd find me nose deep in a novel, or coding a project for fun, catching up on Duolingo lessons or perhaps playing the keyboard! 

Feel free to drop me an e-mail to chat about any of my projects, recommend books or even discuss some French üòÅ.

Bisous,\
Shruthi
