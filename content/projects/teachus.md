TeachUs is a community by teachers, for teachers.

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced both students and teachers alike to rely on online resources to learn and teach. For many teachers, this shift has been far from pleasant. We aim to connect educators across India to come forth and teach each other how to shift to the online mode of education. We offer many courses and resources to make their journey in online teaching as smooth as possible. We have created a community for teachers where they can share their thoughts and views regarding anything and everything - be it the latest tool to conduct pop quizzes, or the best tool to conduct meetings virtually.

TeachUs aims to teach those who have spent years teaching us ðŸ˜Š.
