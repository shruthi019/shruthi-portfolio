MaskifAI is a mask detection web app which can be used by an organization to ensure that their employees wear a mask while entering the workspace. It will also detect whether the mask is worn properly or not. 

The user needs to be authorized as an employee of the organization in order to access the mask detection feature. This has been implemented with a login feature in the app. 

Additionally, if one is authorized as the admin of MaskifAI, they can request the data of the day's defaulters as an email. This feature is not available to regular users of MaskifAI.
